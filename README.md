Sketch in 3D

Written in Java using the Processing and Peasycam Libraries.

Dependencies:
Processing Core Library 1.x - http://processing.org/
Peasy Cam Library 1.x - http://mrfeinberg.com/peasycam/

Note this project requires using projection and model matrices accessed directly from OpenGL in order to retrieve mouse positions in 3d space. Apparently this is broken in Processing 2.0. 

See http://wiki.processing.org/w/Advanced_OpenGL

So I am inluding the requied but outdated libraries with the source.

The easiest way to get started with this code is.

1. Install Eclipse - http://www.eclipse.org/
2. Import this as a new project.
